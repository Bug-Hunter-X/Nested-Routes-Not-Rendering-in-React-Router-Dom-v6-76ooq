# React Router Dom v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router Dom v6.  The problem is that nested routes sometimes fail to render properly, leading to unexpected behavior such as blank pages or incorrect component display.  The solution provided addresses this issue and shows how to correctly implement nested routes for optimal functionality. 

## Problem

The original `App.js` file contains a basic React Router Dom v6 setup with nested routes. The nested routes, however, fail to render. 

## Solution

The `AppSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation, ensuring that nested routes render correctly.  This involves carefully structuring the routes and addressing potential conflicts or misconfigurations within the routing structure.  The solution emphasizes the proper use of the `Outlet` component to render nested routes correctly.
